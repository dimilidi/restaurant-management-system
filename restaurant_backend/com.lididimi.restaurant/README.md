# RMS - Restaurant Management System

**RMS** is a user-friendly Restaurant Management System designed to help both employees and management efficiently serve guests and organize daily tasks.
The website is built with Spring Boot in the backend and Angular in the frontend.

This project is a result of my efforts during a Java Software Engineering Course by [SofUni](https://softuni.bg/) | 2024.

## 1. Prerequisites

For building and running the application you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 17git  or later)
- Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm
- Angular CLI
- Maven
- Git

## 2. Project Structure

The Restaurant Management System (RMS) application is divided into two main parts:
restaurant_backend and restaurant_frontend.

- **restaurant_backend** contains the backend logic and is further divided into two modules:
  - **com.lididimi.restaurant** is the core of the Restaurant Management System, handling all the business logic and interactions.
  - **restaurant_categories** module provides category services which are utilized by the RMS.
- **restaurant_frontend** contains the frontend application, built using Angular, which interacts with the backend to provide a user interface for managing the restaurant.


## 3. Technologies
Some of the key technologies used in the project include:

**Backend:**
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- Bcrypt
- JsonWebToken
- Cloudinary
- JUnit 5
- Mockito

**Database:**
- MySQL

**Frontend:**
- Angular
- Rxjs

**Deployment:**
- Microsoft Azure (backend and database)
- Netlify (frontend)

## 4. Setup

To run RMS application on your local machine you have two main alternatives:  
    ðŸ‘‰ clone the GitHub repository  
    ðŸ‘‰ pull the docker images from Docker Hub.

### 4.1. Clone the Repository

#### 1. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

1) Open a terminal or command prompt.
2) Clone the repository

```    
git clone https://@github.com:dimilidi/restaurant-management-system.git
  ```
3) Navigate to the backend directory and com.lididimi.restaurant app
```    
cd restaurant_backend/com.lididimi.restaurant
  ```
Step 2: Configure the Backend
1) Open the *src/main/resources/application.yaml* file.
2) Update the database connection settings and any other required configurations.
   Ensure placeholders like ${db_password} are replaced with actual values or set them as environment variables.

Step 3: Build the Backend

1) Ensure Maven is installed. You can verify this by running mvn -v.
2) Compile and package the Spring Boot application using Maven:
``` 
mvn clean install
``` 
To run the Spring Boot application:
``` 
mvn spring-boot:run
``` 
Alternatively, you can start the application by executing the main method of the main application class (*RestaurantManagementSystemApplication*) from your IDE.  
The backend will be running at http://localhost:9090.

Step 4: Navigate to category service
```    
cd restaurant_backend/restaurant_categories
  ```

Step 5: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for category app  
The category service will be running at http://localhost:8081.

#### 2. Frontend Setup (Angular)

Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Directory

1) Open a new terminal or command prompt.
2) Navigate to the frontend directory:
```    
cd  restaurant_frontend
  ```

Step 2: Install Node.js Dependencies

1) Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Verify by running node -v and npm -v.
2) Install the required dependencies:
```    
npm install
  ```

Step 3: Serve the Frontend

To start a local development server:
```    
ng serve
  ```
This will start the Angular application on http://localhost:4200.


#### 3. Access the Application
1) Ensure the backend Spring Boot application is running at http://localhost:9090.
2) Ensure the category service application is running at http://localhost:8081.
3) Ensure the Angular development server is running at http://localhost:4200.
4) Open a web browser.
   Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to interact with the Angular frontend.


### 4.2. Docker Setup
You can also run the backend services using Docker images. 
The Docker images for the Restaurant and Categories services are available on Docker Hub. 

#### 1. Pull Docker Images
You can pull the Docker images from Docker Hub using the following commands:
```
docker pull lidididi/restaurant:v2
docker pull lidididi/categories:v2
```

#### 2. Run Services with Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to set up and run the database, restaurant, and categories services. 
The docker-compose.yml is in the docker folder of the Restaurant Service.  
Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file 
and add and configure the environment variables listed in the `env.example` file. 


#### 3. Start the Services

Run the following command in the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file:

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

#### 4. Verify the Services

Ensure the services are running by executing:

```
 docker-compose ps
```
